**About Me**

I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/">Nisarg Shah</a>. Before joining here, I received my M.Sc. Degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology where I had the honor to be advised by <a href="http://sharif.ir/~ghodsi/?page=home">Mohammad Ghodsi</a>.
